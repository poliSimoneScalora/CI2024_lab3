In this code I implemented an A* algorithm. 
I used a combination of Manhattan Distance, the sum of the vertical and horizontal distances of each tile from its goal position, and Linear Conflict, additional penalties for tiles that are in the same row or column but in the wrong order. Additionally, I implemented a way to first see if the puzzle is solvable or not before running the algorithm.


I worked with Giorgio Rondinone and Lorenzo Lombardi.
